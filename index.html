    <h1>Akan Name</h1>
    <p>This is a web application that tells you the day of the week you were born by assigning you an Akan name.
         Akan names are derived from the Ghanian culture where children are given their first name as a 'day name'.
          These names correspond to the day of the week they were born and vary depending on gender.<br> 
          This application will calculate the day of the week you were born using only your birthday date and will reveal the day you were born through an Akan name depending on your gender. </p>
    <p>Below are the Akan names for both genders:
        <h2>MALE</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sunday: Kwasi</li>
            <li>Monday: Kwadwo</li>
            <li>Tuesday: Kwabena</li>
            <li>Wednesday: Kwaku</li>
            <li>Thursday: Yaw</li>
            <li>Friday: Kofi</li>
